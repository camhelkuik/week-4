Each ComboBox should contain a category of food offered by the resaurant (Beverage, Appetizer, Main Course and Dessert). The user can choose from one of these ComboBoxes to add an item to a tabel's bill. As each item is selected in the ComboBoxes, add the price of that item to the bill. The user can click the Clear Bill Button to restore the Subtotal, Tax and Total fields to $0.00.
